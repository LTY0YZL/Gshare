            <h6 class="section-title">What is the purpose of G-Share?</h6>
            <p class="mb-6">
                The purpose of G-Share is to transform the grocery shopping experience by creating a collaborative shopping platform. G-Share connects neighbors who are already planning 
                grocery store visits with those who need groceries but lack the time, energy, or budget for traditional shopping trips or delivery options. This platform addresses a common 
                household challenge by providing an efficient, affordable alternative to conventional delivery apps that have high fees. Through G-Share, community members help each other obtain 
                essential items, creating both convenience and neighborhood connections.
            </p>

            <h6 class="section-title">Who is G-Share for?</h6>
            <p>
                G-Share is a product that would greatly benefit two groups of people. First, it will benefit shoppers. These are community members who are already planning to visit grocery stores 
                and are willing to pick up additional items for neighbors along their scheduled route to make some extra cash while helping their neighbors. On the other hand, it will benefit requesters. 
                These are busy individuals, parents, elderly community members, or anyone who needs groceries but faces barriers to in-person shopping.   The easiest way to get groceries is to travel to 
                the store and get them yourself, however, for many people, this isn’t an option.  The elderly who struggle to get around, or people who don’t have time to make it to the store are left with 
                having groceries delivered to them.  However there is a flaw with this system as well, since many stores don’t have a delivery system, and if they do it often has high costs from shipping, 
                delivery fees, or you need to have premium memberships which is an additional cost.  Our service reduces costs for customers, creates earning opportunities for shoppers, and strengthens 
                community bonds. G-Share makes grocery delivery accessible to those with mobility limitations, busy schedules, or transportation challenges—all while providing significant savings compared to traditional delivery services.

                        Hello, I am Abdul. I am a graduating Computer Science student at the University of Utah and a member of the G-Share team. I helped build the frontend of our web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while also assisting with some of the backend implementations of the features I have been working on. The features that I helped build include User Identification (login, sign-up, profiles, reviews), payments, recurring orders, and finally the AI ordering assistant. I enjoy software development and engineering, and I am also interested in learning about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity.

                        Hello, my name is Jason Davies. I am currently pursuing my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Utah, with just one semester left before graduation. Throughout my studies, I have taken numerous courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which have become the primary areas of computer science that interest me the most. I am fascinated by the rapid development of AI and look forward to seeing how these technologies continue to evolve and create meaningful improvements in people’s lives.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition to AI and ML, I also have an interest in computer hardware and architecture. Although I have taken fewer classes in that area, I am eager to learn more and have recently developed a growing curiosity about computer components and the process of building systems from the ground up.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring video games—both from a technical standpoint and as a hobby. I also appreciate art and drawing, and I spend a good amount of my free time reading. When I’m not studying or working on projects, I enjoy watching football and basketball.

                    <p class="team-member-bio">
                        Hi, I’m Anand Raju Palukuri, a Computer Science major at the University of Utah graduating in December 2025. I’m passionate about building full-stack applications that balance strong backend engineering with intuitive, accessible design. My academic background includes algorithms, machine learning, human-centered design, database systems, and data visualization, giving me both technical depth and a user-centered perspective.
                        <br><br>
                        Professionally, I worked as a Software Engineer at Coordinator, Inc., where I built a contract-generation application using C#, .NET MAUI, and React. I developed WCAG-compliant interfaces, automated DOCX parsing, and integrated more than 32 document-processing APIs, and helped shorten QA cycles by 30% through iterative development and agile practices.
                        <br><br>
                        A major part of my experience has been working as part of a team on G-Share, a full-stack grocery-sharing platform designed to support community-based delivery. Within the team, I contributed to backend architecture, optimised MySQL queries for performance, integrated AWS S3 for media handling, and implemented Google Maps features for distance filtering and route visualisation. I also developed G-Share’s AI Scan system, a Gemini-powered workflow that scans receipts, extracts and corrects items through chat, matches them to active orders, and enables automated delivery confirmation inside a real-time chat interface.
                        <br><br>
                        Outside of G-Share, I’ve worked on several technical projects. I built an Android Malware Detection pipeline with custom ML ensembles, achieving 91.98% accuracy. I also created an interactive Data Visualisation Dashboard using D3.js to explore U.S. startup funding and CS salary trends. Additionally, I helped design a Learning Management System by building a 10-table MySQL schema with role-based access control and implementing LINQ-driven backend logic.
                        <br><br>
                        Across all my work, I enjoy solving meaningful problems and creating polished software that people genuinely enjoy using.
